│ use scrapetube to get the video id's for a channel or playlist
│ use youtube-transcript-api to download transcript from video id

see how fastembed works -- will save money doing local inference

test:
    - download one transcript (15 mins) and see how big it is in data
    - create embedding and submit it as rag and see how much data is sent

    WHAT MATTERS:
    - only time I send data to llm:
        - documents found in RAG
        - user query
        - rolling context?

    Test:
        - download one transcript (1 hour -- the king of the games one)
        - view size
        - write code to download it then pass info to embedding model
        - 

Next:
    - try to get it to generate a timestamp, start and end

Production:

    - use ASYNC qdrant
